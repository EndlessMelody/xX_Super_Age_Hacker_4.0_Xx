# Smart Age Calculator (Extremely Intelligent Edition)

A web application that calculates your age with the sophistication of a quantum computer and the reliability of a 90s dial-up connection. Built with love, chaos, and questionable design choices by Dang Khoa.

## What Is This?

This is a "troll" age calculator that pretends to be a sophisticated hacking tool while actually just... calculating your age. It features a Y2K aesthetic, Web Brutalism design, and enough visual chaos to make your eyes question their life choices.

## Features

- **Fake Hacking Interface**: Watch as the app pretends to bypass firewalls, hack NASA, and download RAM from the dark web, all while calculating your age
- **Toxic Messages**: Get roasted based on your age input. The app doesn't hold back
- **Visual Chaos**: Rainbow gradients, floating popups, fake cursors, screen shakes, and more. Your browser will hate you
- **Background Images**: Random images float around in the background, because why not?
- **Fake Terminal Logs**: Watch fake system logs scroll by as if something important is happening
- **Confetti Explosion**: Because every age calculation deserves a celebration (or a funeral, depending on the result)
- **Epilepsy Warning**: We're not kidding. This thing flashes like a rave party

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Because installing dependencies is the most exciting part of any project.

## Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open your browser and prepare to question your life choices. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite decides to use).

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Build the project if you want to subject others to this experience. We won't judge.

## How It Works

1. User enters their age (or tries to, we accept letters too just to troll them)
2. App pretends to hack the mainframe for 13 seconds
3. Fake terminal logs appear, making it look like something important is happening
4. Confetti explodes (because why not)
5. User gets their age back (shocking, we know) along with a toxic message based on their age range

## Age Categories & Responses

- **Under 10**: "Go do your homework, kid"
- **10-17**: "Stop playing games and study"
- **18-25**: "Enjoy your youth while it lasts"
- **26-40**: "Back pain detected, initiating ibuprofen"
- **40+**: "Ok boomer, need help with PDFs?"

Special cases include negative numbers, numbers over 100, and the number 69 (you know why).

## Technologies Used

- **React 19**: Because we like living on the edge
- **Vite**: Fast builds, faster regrets
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling that makes designers cry
- **Canvas Confetti**: Because celebrations are mandatory
- **Lucide React**: Icons that actually look good (unlike the rest of the design)

## Important Notes

- This application contains flashing lights and may cause seizures. We're not kidding. There's a warning for a reason.
- The toxic messages are for entertainment purposes only. Don't take them personally (or do, we're not your therapist).
- This is a joke project. Don't use it for actual age calculations in production (unless you want to).
- The "hacking" is completely fake. We're not actually hacking anything. Probably.

## Final Thoughts

If you've made it this far, congratulations. You've read the README for a troll age calculator. Your life is now complete. Or maybe it's just beginning. Who knows? Not us, that's for sure.

Enjoy the chaos. Or don't. We're not your boss.
